{Feeding the Starter}

    \ingredients
    {
		113 & g of starter \\
		113 & g of unbleached AP flour \\
		113 & g of room-temperature water \\
    }
    
    \preparation
    {
        \step Take jar of starter out of fridge, and stir. In a new jar, place desired amount of starter and discard the rest to the trash or to a recipe. 
		\step Add flour and water and stir to combine. \\
		\step Leave on the counter for 2 - 3 hours before placing back in the fridge, and feed again in a week. If leaving on the counter, feed again in 12 hours. 
    }
	
	\suggestion
	{
		An active, ready starter should double in volume within 4~hours after feeding. As a first approach, feed once, leave at room temperature for 12 hours, feed a second time, and the starter should be ready to go in 4 hours.
