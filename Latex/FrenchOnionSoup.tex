		\step Add wine and sherry, raise heat to high. 
		\\

		\step Add beef broth and bundle of herbs (thyme and bay leaves tied together with kitchen twine). 
		\step Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer, then cook for 20 to 30 minutes, until thickened. 
		\step Remove from heat and stir in 1~Tbsp of butter. 
    }

	\hint
	{
		This takes an age to cook (particularly the onions), so start early while doing something else.
