	{
		To cook stuffing outside bird, place stuffing into lightly buttered casserole dish and add additional 1~cup of chicken broth (or less, if it starts looking drowned). Compress, cover, and cook at 325$^{\circ}$~F for 30 to 45 minutes. If it's been contaminated by bird juice, make sure it reaches appropriate temperature of 165$^{\circ}$~F.
