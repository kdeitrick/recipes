	\suggestion
	{
		To cook stuffing outside bird, place stuffing into lightly buttered 2-quart casserole dish and add additional 1~cup of chicken broth. Compress, cover, and cook at 325$^{\circ}$F for 30 minutes; uncover and cook an additional 15 minutes. If it's been contaminated by bird juice, make sure it reaches appropriate temperature of 165$^{\circ}$F.
	}
	
    \hint
    {
        1 slice of bread $= \sfrac{1}{2}$~cup bread cubes. I typically double the parsley and onion. 
    }
