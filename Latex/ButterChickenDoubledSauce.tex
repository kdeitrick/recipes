    \preparation
    {
        \step Heat ghee in the large skillet. Fry the onions until they start to sweat, about 6 minutes, while scraping up any browned bits stuck on the bottom of the pan. 
		\step Add garlic and ginger and saut\'e for 1 minute until fragrant, then add ground coriander, cumin, and garam masala. Let cook for about 20 seconds until fragrant, while stirring occasionally. 
		\step Add crushed tomatoes, chili powder, and salt. Let simmer for about 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally until sauce thickens and becomes a deep brown red colour. 
		\step Remove from heat, scoop mixture into a blender and blend until smooth. You may need to add a couple tablespoons of water to help it blend (up to $\sfrac{1}{4}$ cup). Work in batches depending on the size of your blender.
		\step Pour the pur\'eed sauce back into the pan. Stir in the cream, sugar, and crushed kasoori methi / fenugreek leaves through the sauce. 
		\step Add the chicken with juices back into the pan and cook for an additional 8 to 10 minutes until chicken is cooked through and the sauce is thick and bubbling. 
		%\step Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve with fresh, hot garlic butter rice or fresh homemade Naan bread.
