{Broiled Salmon with Thai Sweet Chili Glaze}
    
    \ingredients
    {
		(4) & 6~oz salmon filets, skin on or off \\
		$\sfrac{3}{4}$ & cup Thai Sweet Chili Sauce (Mae Ploy) \\
		$\sfrac{3}{8}$ & cup soy sauce \\
		2 & Tbsp ginger, grated \\
    }
    
    \preparation
    {
        \step \textbf{To make marinade:} Combine sweet chili sauce, soy sauce, and ginger in a bowl. Reserve 3/4~cup in small container and set aside; this will be the sauce for the cooked fish.
		\step Place salmon, skin side up, in dish or ziploc and cover with marinade. Marinate for 1 hour in refrigerator.
		\step \textbf{To cook fish:} Set oven rack 5-6 inches from the top and preheat the broiler. 
		\step Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil sprayed with nonstick spray. \\
		\step Transfer salmon to prepared baking sheet, skin side down, and drizzle a bit of marinade on top. Go easy -- you don't want it to pool too much on baking sheet because it will burn in the oven. 
		\step Broil salmon for 6 to 10 minutes, or until browned in spots. \\
		\step Serve with rice and reserved sauce. 
    }
	
	\hint
	{
		Look for salmon temperature around 130$^{\circ}$~F. Safety temperature is 145$^{\circ}$~F, but cooking continues after being removed from oven.
